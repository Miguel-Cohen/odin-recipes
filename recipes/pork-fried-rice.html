    <h2>About this recipe</h2>

    <p>This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. 
        I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. 
        I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice 
        which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. 
        I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.</p>
