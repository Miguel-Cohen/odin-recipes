    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken with the lime juice, salt and pepper.

        <li>Sauté the onion with the garlic until fragrant, adding in the chicken.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken cook for a few minutes. After it starts to brown, add a spoonful of

        <li>Let cook just until the chicken is cooked through, and transfer into a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Add the béchamel and the mustard and mix thoroughly.
            Pop it in the oven at 200ºC sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and let brown.</li>
